## What is this?
This is a repository that contains files of codes to the data analysis of current top 10 ATP & WTA tennis players H2H statistics. We can see each individual player's H2H statistics against another player in top 10 ranking as well as their overall winning percentage against the players ranked in top 10 at the moment. The data visualisation is done through a heat map chart.
