## What is this?
This is a repository that contains files of codes to the data analysis of current top 10 ATP & WTA tennis players H2H statistics. We can see each individual player's H2H statistics against another player in top 10 ranking as well as their overall winning percentage against the players ranked in top 10 at the moment. The data visualisation is done through a heat map chart. 

## ATP Top 10 H2H Heat Map & Comments

- Alcaraz, Sinner, and Djokovic have the best performance against all Top 10 players with around 70% winning rate with more than 60 games played against this list of players.
- The worst ratio is shown by Shelton & De Minaur with 17% and 28% winning rate, respectively. The rest of the players have shown nearly 40-50% of winning rate against the current Top 10 players.
- Against current World number 1, Alcaraz, Djokovic shows the best winning rate of 50% with 10 games played between the two.
- At the same time, the best winning % against Sinner (World no. 2) is shown by Alcaraz with 65% and a total of 17 games played.

***Important note:*** the percentages might not reflect the actual current strengths of the players against Top 10 ranked players as there are factors such as when the games were played, in what stages of their careers the players were when the games were played, whether the players were in their prime, what court surface was, and which tournament games were played at, are not taken into account.

## Interesting Observations to Note
- In both charts, there seems to be a pattern in the winning percentages for players who perform neither very good nor very bad, in other words, mid performance players against Top 10 ranked players. It is always close to 50% for both ATP & WTA players.
- For both heat maps, we can observe 1 case of players have zero games in total played against each other. In case of ATP players, it is Alcaraz against Bublik while for WTA players, it is Andreeva against Pegula.
